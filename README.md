## Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Deployment
The website is deployed at : https://shreyamishra9618.github.io/work-day-scheduler/



I have used [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
